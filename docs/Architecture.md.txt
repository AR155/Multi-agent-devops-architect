Multi-Agent DevOps Architect – Architecture


Vision :- The project aims to build an **AI-driven, Multi-Agent DevOps Architecture** that automates infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD, monitoring, and optimization.  
Each agent focuses on a specific role (Planner, IaC Generator, CI/CD Executor, Monitor, Optimizer) and collaborates to deliver end-to-end DevOps workflows.


High-Level Agent Design
- **Planner Agent** → Reads project requirements & proposes infra/DevOps setup.
- **IaC Generator Agent** → Creates Terraform/Docker/K8s manifests for infra.
- **CI/CD Agent** → Sets up pipelines (GitHub Actions/Jenkins).
- **Monitor Agent** → Observes system health, logs, and metrics.
- **Optimizer Agent** → Suggests improvements, scaling, cost optimization.


Tech Stack
- **Language** → Python (agents, orchestration)
- **Infra as Code** → Terraform, Docker
- **Pipelines** → GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)
- **Container Orchestration** → Kubernetes / Minikube (local testing)
- **Version Control** → Git + GitHub
- **Monitoring** → Prometheus + Grafana
